# OpenAL config file. Options that are not under a block or are under the
# [general] block are for general, non-backend-specific options. Blocks may
# appear multiple times, and duplicated options will take the last value
# specified.
# The system-wide settings can be put in /etc/openal/alsoft.conf and user-
# specific override settings in ~/.alsoftrc.
# For Windows, these settings should go into %AppData%\alsoft.ini

# Option and block names are case-insenstive. The supplied values are only
# hints and may not be honored (though generally it'll try to get as close as
# possible). Note: options that are left unset may default to app- or system-
# specified values. These are the current available settings:

## channels:
#  Sets the output channel configuration. If left unspecified, one will try to
#  be detected from the system, and defaulting to stereo. The available values
#  are: mono, stereo, quad, surround51, surround61, surround71
#channels = stereo

## sample-type:
#  Sets the output sample type. Currently, all mixing is done with 32-bit float
#  and converted to the output sample type as needed. Available values are:
#  int8    - signed 8-bit int
#  uint8   - unsigned 8-bit int
#  int16   - signed 16-bit int
#  uint16  - unsigned 16-bit int
#  int32   - signed 32-bit int
#  uint32  - unsigned 32-bit int
#  float32 - 32-bit float
#sample-type = float32

## hrtf:
#  Enables HRTF filters. These filters provide for better sound spatialization
#  while using headphones. The default filter will only work when output is
#  44100hz stereo. While HRTF is active, the cf_level option is disabled.
#  Default is disabled since stereo speaker output quality may suffer.
#hrtf = false

## hrtf_tables
#  Specifies a comma-separated list of files containing HRTF data sets. The
#  listed data sets can be used in place of or in addiiton to the the built-in
#  set. The format of the files are described in hrtf.txt.
#hrtf_tables =

## cf_level:
#  Sets the crossfeed level for stereo output. Valid values are:
#  0 - No crossfeed
#  1 - Low crossfeed
#  2 - Middle crossfeed
#  3 - High crossfeed (virtual speakers are closer to itself)
#  4 - Low easy crossfeed
#  5 - Middle easy crossfeed
#  6 - High easy crossfeed
#  Users of headphones may want to try various settings. Has no effect on non-
#  stereo modes.
#cf_level = 0

## frequency:
#  Sets the output frequency.
#frequency = 44100

## resampler:
#  Selects the resampler used when mixing sources. Valid values are:
#  point - nearest sample, no interpolation
#  linear - extrapolates samples using a linear slope between samples
#  cubic - extrapolates samples using a Catmull-Rom spline
#  Specifying other values will result in using the default (linear).
#resampler = linear

## rt-prio:
#  Sets real-time priority for the mixing thread. Not all drivers may use this
#  (eg. PortAudio) as they already control the priority of the mixing thread.
#  0 and negative values will disable it. Note that this may constitute a
#  security risk since a real-time priority thread can indefinitely block
#  normal-priority threads if it fails to wait. As such, the default is
#  disabled.
#rt-prio = 0

## period_size:
#  Sets the update period size, in frames. This is the number of frames needed
#  for each mixing update. Acceptable values range between 64 and 8192.
#period_size = 1024

## periods:
#  Sets the number of update periods. Higher values create a larger mix ahead,
#  which helps protect against skips when the CPU is under load, but increases
#  the delay between a sound getting mixed and being heard. Acceptable values
#  range between 2 and 16.
#periods = 4

## sources:
#  Sets the maximum number of allocatable sources. Lower values may help for
#  systems with apps that try to play more sounds than the CPU can handle.
#sources = 256

## stereodup:
#  Sets whether to duplicate stereo sounds behind the listener. This provides a
#  "fuller" playback quality for surround sound output modes, although each
#  individual speaker will have a slight reduction in volume to compensate for
#  the extra output speakers. True, yes, on, and non-0 values will duplicate
#  stereo sources. 0 and anything else will cause stereo sounds to only play in
#  front. This only has an effect when a suitable output format is used (ie.
#  those that contain side and/or rear speakers).
#stereodup = true

## drivers:
#  Sets the backend driver list order, comma-seperated. Unknown backends and
#  duplicated names are ignored. Unlisted backends won't be considered for use
#  unless the list is ended with a comma (eg. 'oss,' will list OSS first
#  followed by all other available backends, while 'oss' will list OSS only).
#  Backends prepended with - won't be available for use (eg. '-oss,' will allow
#  all available backends except OSS). An empty list means the default.
#drivers = pulse,alsa,core,oss,solaris,sndio,mmdevapi,dsound,winmm,port,opensl,null,wave

## excludefx:
#  Sets which effects to exclude, preventing apps from using them. This can
#  help for apps that try to use effects which are too CPU intensive for the
#  system to handle. Available effects are: eaxreverb,reverb,echo,modulator,
#  dedicated
#excludefx =

## slots:
#  Sets the maximum number of Auxiliary Effect Slots an app can create. A slot
#  can use a non-negligible amount of CPU time if an effect is set on it even
#  if no sources are feeding it, so this may help when apps use more than the
#  system can handle.
#slots = 4

## sends:
#  Sets the number of auxiliary sends per source. When not specified (default),
#  it allows the app to request how many it wants. The maximum value currently
#  possible is 4.
#sends =

## layout:
#  Sets the virtual speaker layout. Values are specified in degrees, where 0 is
#  straight in front, negative goes left, and positive goes right. Unspecified
#  speakers will remain at their default positions (which are dependant on the
#  output format). Available speakers are back-left(bl), side-left(sl), front-
#  left(fl), front-center(fc), front-right(fr), side-right(sr), back-right(br),
#  and back-center(bc).

## boost:

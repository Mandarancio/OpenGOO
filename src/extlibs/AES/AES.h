/* USAGE:
	1. Create a AES class (or more as necessary)
	2. Call class method SetParameters
	3. To encrypt, call method StartEncryption with the key, and then 
		call method Encrypt with enough space to store the proper size blocks.
	4. To decrypt, call method StartDecryption with the key, and then 
		call method Decrypt with enough space to store the proper size blocks.

   Alternatively, you can call EncryptBlock and DecryptBlock block to process blocksize 
   (default to 16 bytes) bytes at a time. It is recommended to use the Encrypt function 
   for multiple block encryption since it uses chaining modes that make the overall 
   stream much more secure than the default block based encryption, which by default would 
   be mode ECB.

   EXAMPLE: want to encrypt 37 bytes of data with 192 bit key, which will use 3 16 byte blocks
   AES aes;
   aes.SetParameters(192);
   aes.StartEncryption(key);
   aes.Encrypt(data,output,3); // note data and output must be at least 48 bytes!
  */

// todo - replace all types with u1byte, u4byte, etc

class AES
	{
public:
	// the constructor - makes sure local things are initialized
	// it if fails, throws the string "Tables failed to initialize"
	AES(void);

	// multiple block encryption/decryption modes
	// See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation
	enum BlockMode {
		ECB = 0, // Electronic CodeBook	  - each block independent, weak
		CBC = 1  // Cipher Block Chaining - most secure
		// todo - CFB = 2, // Cipher FeedBack       - secure
		// todo - OFB = 3, // Output FeedBack		  - secure
		// todo - CTR = 4,  // Counter				  - allows midstream decryption, somewhat secure
		// todo - EAX = 5, - http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/eprint-short-ae.pdf

	// have enough space in datain and dataout to accomodate this. Pad your data before
	// calling, preferably using the padding methods listed below.
	// Decryption must use the same mode as the encryption.
	void Encrypt(const unsigned char * datain, unsigned char * dataout, unsigned long numBlocks, BlockMode mode = CBC);

	void StartDecryption(const unsigned char * key);
	// decrypt a single block (default 128 bits, or unsigned char[16]) of data
	void DecryptBlock(const unsigned char * datain, unsigned char * dataout);
	// Call this to decrypt any length data. Note the size is in BLOCKS, so you must
	// have enough space in datain and dataout to accomodate this. Pad your data before
	// calling, preferably using the padding methods listed below. You must know the desired
	// length of the output data, since all the blocks are returned decrypted. 
	// Encryption must use the same mode as the decryption.
	void Decrypt(const unsigned char * datain, unsigned char * dataout, unsigned long numBlocks, BlockMode mode = CBC);

	int Nb,Nk;    // block and key length / 32, should be 4,6,or 8
	int Nr;       // number of rounds

/* PADDING:
    The AES (Rijndael) encryption algorithm pads encrypted data to a multiple of 16 bytes by default. 
	Other blocksizes are similar. Methods:
    1. RFC 1423 padding scheme: 
	   Each padding byte is set to the number of padding bytes. If the data is already a multiple 
	   of 16 bytes, 16 additional bytes are added, each having the value 0x10.
    2. FIPS81 (Federal Information Processing Standards 81): 
	   The last byte contains the number of padding bytes, including itself, 
	   and the other padding bytes are set to random values.
    3. Each padding byte is set to a random value. The decryptor must know how many bytes are in the original unencrypted data.
	*/

/* TODO
The Encrypt() function is used to encrypt larger blocks of data. The block size has to be a multiple of the method's block size. 
This function can operate in the following modes: ECB, CBC or CFB. ECB mode is not using chaining. If the same block is encrypted 
twice with the same key, the resulting ciphertext blocks are the same. In CBC mode, a ciphertext block is obtained by first XORing 
the plaintext block with the previous ciphertext block, and encrypting the resulting value. In CFB mode, a ciphertext block is 
obtained by encrypting the previous ciphertext block and XORing the resulting value with the plaintext. The operation mode is 
specified in the iMode parameter with ECB being the default value.

- Version 0.7.4 (beta 2):
- Fixed "can't add some end conditions" problem

- Version 0.7.4 (beta):
- Full Dependancy Checking and display (new Depends tab)
  -- Done on Load and make Goomod
  - Finds all custom dependancies of the level
  - New Ball Types, custom images, sounds, particles, materials
  - Fully Recursive so it will check...
  -- dispensers and the balls they create, and the images and particles they use
  -- Mom Balls and whatever comes out of them, and whatever comes out of the children etc
  - Depends Tab shows all custom dependancies
  -- Also shows "issues" (like the other trees) when something is required but is missing.
  -- Missing items prevent you making the goomod

- Dependancy Localization into goomod
  - Option when making a goomod to include ALL custom dependancies
  - Includes all custom ball data (ball folders, xml files, images, sounds)
  - Automatically creates and includes fx.xml.xsl for custom particle effects (level or ball)
  - Automatically creates and includes materials.xml.xsl for custom materials

  - displays custom pipes in bright red on the level view

- Level Names (folders) that are just a number, cause untold problems (with GooTool and the game)
  - New level names must now START with a letter, but can contain numbers elsewhere

- Now processes SetDefaults entries in level resource files
  - Resolves id and path on all entries and resets SetDefaults to "","./"
  - Also Normalizes all paths to "/" separators

Visual Changes
- Labels are now correctly positioned according to their align attribute.
- Images applied to compgeom now show centred on compgeom if no imagepos attribute is specified.
- re-"grouped" most of the items so they have new / different tree icons

Property / MetaModel Changes
- Labels
  - the misleadingly named "center" attribute is now called "position"
  - overlay and screenspace are now optional
- most level root attributes are now optional (autobounds, strandgeom etc)
- geomonly tag removed from radialforcefields (doesn't work)
- material is now optional
  - The game uses "rock" when material attribute is omitted.
  - so default material ("rock") removed from new geometry items.
- Music and Loopsound attribute is now called sound - rather than id

- Lots of revisions to Ball Meta info (for the purposes of dependancy checking)
  - Many, Many "unknown" attributes changed to reference or enum 
  - Many also now flagged as "is_list"
  - created/added lists of known ball "events" and "states"
  - removed quite a few incorrect "max occurances"

- discovered how to create fully recursive meta info
  - Applied to Folders for original resource info (files.xml.bin)
  - and new Dependancy meta info

- enum_attributes now have an "allow_any" keyword..
  - this gives the completer box, but also accepts anything else the user types
  - Used only on pipe type to allow custom types (for now)

- Changed Back 
  - Fully loads global resources.xml tree
  - new completer functions to give just World Identifiers, rather then World+Parent
  - Prevents all the global resources appearing in the image and sound completer lists.
  - But allows full dependancy checking on original global resources.

- Version 0.7.3:
- Goos now look quite a lot like.. well.. Goos.
 - Works with custom Goos because it used the <body> image
 - Invisible Goos (with no body image) show with the "old-style" black circle.

- Paste is now Paste HERE!
  - Goos, Scenelayers, Geometry ... and most other stuff
  - Ctrl+V (or standard paste shortcut) now pastes the object where the mouse pointer is.
  - REALLY easy to add a load of Goos now (add one, copy it.. and paste paste paste)

- Paste In Place (the old Paste) available on menus and toolbar and by ALT+V

- Paste menus now show you what is on the clipboard 
  - Shows object type .. BallInstance, SceneLayer rectangle etc
  - Note - this is based on last item Cut/Copied (looking to change it to "live" checking)

- Proto-context menus... Right-Click
  - Shows selected item type (top row)
  - Cut, Copy, "Paste Here" and Delete... for now... type specific options coming 'soon'
  
- tag and filter properties now display a dialog with a scrollable list of checkboxes.
  - Just tick the ones you want.
  - filter property only shows goo types that are "suckable", "visible" and not "static"

- Orthogonal Moving
  - Hold CTRL key when moving an object, to restrict movement to either Horz. or Vert.

- Images have Aspect Preserving Resize (Scenelayers, Signposts and Geometry Images)
  - Hold CTRL key to maintain/revert to the ORIGINAL Aspect Ratio of the Image while resizing
  - Hold ALT key to maintain whatever the Aspect Ratio was already

- New Clean Resources button / menu
  - Removes any unused resources from the level (images, sounds and text)

Checks and Advice
- Some XML Parse Error checking (Checks Level and Ball xml's)
- Will alert you to duplicate balls (2 folders, two balls.xml.bin's... same name="{ballname}")

Visual Changes
- Lines, ForceFields, Geometry with Images 
  are now only selected by clicking on a component, not "anywhere in bounding rectangle" 

- Scenelayers and Signpost now display using any alpha value they have set

- All but the last POI now show as "letterboxed"
  - They show pretty close to what you will see
  - and they're 50% transparent so you can see what's behind them when you're moving them.

- Camera's and Poi's are now hidden by default (you'll see why....)

Property and MetaModel Changes
- New End Condition - endonnogeom  
 - This has been known about for some time (apparently)
 - But was never used in the original levels, and never investigated... till now.
 - Simply.. the level ends when there are no Dynamic Geometry objects left.
 - See the online reference guide for more details

- depth attribute removed from BallInstance (error in original WoG Editor)
- discovered now removed when empty
- levelexit/filter now removed when empty
- depth and id removed from pipes (neither attribute was required or did anything)
- levelexit id now entirely optional

- Version 0.7.2:
* New Text Edit Dialog for Text Resources and Addin Description
  - Automatically replaces line breaks {enter} with '|'
  - Converts '|'  back to line break for editting

* Undo stack extended to 100 actions (accidentally set to 10 in v0.71)
* Added REDO!
  - Just in case you Undo too many times.. It will redo the last Undone action

* Lines now show their normal and have a drag handle to change their direction

* Anim property now has completer list of all the global animations
  - Most of them won't be a lot of use, but at least you can see what they are called
  - blink, ocdFlagWave, happyTreeDance are probably most useful after rot_1fps

* Rudimentary Dependancy checking - Warns when creating a goomod
  - Checks for Custom Balls, Materials and Particle Effects

* Visual and Layout Changes
- New icons for quite a few things
- New Edit Toolbar (Cut Copy Paste Undo etc)
- New Resource Menu (same options as Resource Toolbar)
- Moved Add Text Resource from item bar to Resource bar / menu
- Now stores and restores the toolbar layout if you change it
- Tree Tabs (Scene,Level,Resource etc) and Properties Pane locked in place
  - They can all still be resized, but not moved, floated or closed.

* More checks and advice
  - Now checks for Ambient Particle Effects used on Fire or SignPost Objects
  - Checks for Single Poi with large traveltime (causes delay starting level)
  - Warning on hinges applied to composite geometry children, 'cos they don't work right.
    - hinges must be applied to the compositegeom parent item.
  - Now handles missing ball types. Shows the Missing Goos in Red, and flags a tree issue.

* Property / MetaModel Changes
  - New CHILD_RECT and CHILD_CIRCLE elements
  - - They have been slimmed right down to include only attributes which can have any effect 
  - - Removed.. image stuff, material, tag, rotspeed, contacts, nogeomcollisions and STATIC
  - - These were all either unnecessary, non-functional or only inherited from the compgeom
  - - Also id on children is entirely optional, use it for a "meaningful" name if you want

  - CompGeom now has contacts attribute 
  - - Although it suffers from the same "sticky" bug as tags do.

  - Normalized the order of the attributes on Rect,Circle and CompGeom

  - Reordered the attributes on quite a few other items...
  - Approx new order
  -- Name / ID
  -- Position, Size, Rotation, Depth
  -- Type, material, tags, other useful and item-specific options like force or text
  -- Image
  -- Other options you might need, but won't use a lot

  -- Label Id now starts empty.. and you can leave it like that if you want.

  - UtilGooGlobberMom and UtilGooGlobberMomQuiet removed from "No Strands" list
  - List added of Original Balltypes, Materials, Ambient and Local Particles
    - For dependancy checking
  - Scenebounds (min/max x/y) are now allowed to be empty.
  - Multiple endoncollision items are now allowed.
  - - level ends if any one of them happens

* Bug Fixes
Fixed: unknown Balltype if ball folder name is not case-sensitive match to name=".." in balls.xml
Fixed: Infinite Loop on Save (cleaning tree), if there was a properly Missing Ball

- Version 0.7.1:
* Fixed the Addin Id bug
* Fixed Typo in the About box
* Downgraded "Multiple End Conditions" from Warning to Advice
* imagerot, rotspeed and a couple others I missed can now be unset (set blank)

oh.. and..
* Added UNDO!
  - Works on Adding, Deleting Items and changing attributes, including graphically.
  - A few "Actions" need more than one UNDO to undo.
    - Auto-Pipe : Undoes 1 vertex at a time if there was a pipe already
    - Import Image(s) : 1 Undo per image imported
    - Set Music / LoopSound : Varies
	2x if this was the first time it was set
	   (Remove music item, remove imported sound resource)
	3x if you were replacing existing music.
	   (Add old sound resource back, swap music id back, remove new resource)


- Version 0.7.0 (Final):
* TEXT Resource handling added!
  - New Text Tab where you can add the text resources for your signposts and labels
  - Saves Text entries in the level folder {levelname}.text.xml
  - Automatically creates text.xml in your goomod (if it's needed)
  - Adds the text into the global text.xml.bin when you click Play
  --- So that you can check it in the game, straight away!
  - Only lists "Local" Text Resources in the completer boxes

* Automatic Localization of Existing Global Text Resources  (err...what?...)
  - If you clone an original Level...
  --- You get local COPIES of all the sign and label text
  --- You can change these without affecting the original level
  - If you open an "old" / existing custom level, which has signs or labels...
  --- Any text will be transferred from the Global text file to the new Local file.
  --- Meaning you can edit it in WoG editor, and it'll saved with the level and put in the goomod
  --- NB: Level must be currently installed and enabled with GooTool to transfer the text

* Text Resource, Sign and Label added to Item bar
  - Also rearranged a few of the other items into vague groups

* Now supports the "thB JPG fiddle" for reducing image file size
  - WoG Editor will display images that use this "feature"
  - NB: You can still only import *.png as resources

* New issue severity level : ADVICE
  - This is for non-critical but helpful or "good practice" things
  -- eg. Unused Resources, non-static but rotated compgeom objects
  - You will be alerted to Advice issues, when you play or goomod
  -- In BOTH cases you can continue or cancel.

* "Linux Friendly" - well.. "Friendly"-er
  - Select WoG Directory now looks for WorldOfGoo.*  (rather than specifically .exe or .bin)
  - Automatic conversion of \ to / in resource paths (on load)

* Tree Tabs (Scene and Level)
  - Signs now show their name in the tree
  - Cameras show their aspect setting in the tree
  - "Only one allowed" applied to pipe,levelexit,targetheight,endoncollision,endonmessage

* Addin Tab 
  - now shows the values in the tree.
  - validates the OCD and won't accept invalid settings
  - validates Addin Id, which has some particularly tight rules in GooTool
  - - It pretty much has to look like a domain name  (com.goofans.YourName.LevelName)
  - - Can only contain letters, numbers and '.' (dots)
  - - Must contain at least one dot
  - - Must not start or end with a dot, and cannot contain '..' (2 dots together)

* New final checks on...
  - Goos and Strands - in case you changed the goo type to something that can't have a strand.
  - multiple different End Conditions (warns if you have a levelexit and a targetheight for example)
  - Targetheight - Warns if any Goos start above the target, so your level will finish immediately
  - Image and Sound Resources to confirm / ensure that file paths are correct
  - Spinning geometry objects without hinges to hold them in place (interesting if you ignore the warning)

* Visual Changes
  - Signs now appear as a Red Square until they have an image.
  - Strands are now coloured in increasing shades of red when they get too long (bright red means they will probably break straight away)
  - Widescreen POIs and endcamera now represent "worst-case" 16:9 ratio

* Fixes
  - Fatal Exception on Exit (Bug in PyQT 4.7.2 fixed in 4.7.3)
  - GFX and Sound files from the original balls folder added to files.xml
  --- Stops it putting them in goomods because it thinks they are "custom" files.
  - Labels now rotate correctly and text appears in the game where the center is.
  - Ambient LinearForceFields can now be sized, without first giving them a center.
  - Image depth when applied to circle objects
  - Cloned levels now show in Level list without WoG Editor restart
  - Pipe line now updates (immediately) when a vertex is deleted
  - Create New level will now display an error if creating the level folder fails (usually a permissions problem)




- Version 0.6.9:
* Composite Geometry "WORKS"
  - compositegeom elements and children can be added from the Toolbar
    - to add a new child you must first select the compgeom object (or one of its children)
    - children are automatically given a mass = 1 (prevents trouble, and has no ill effects if parent is static)
  - Selecting Child Rectangles / Circles moves them around inside the CompGeom object
  - To access the overall Compgeom Position, Rotation and other properties like material and static
    - Click the green circle at the center point
    - Can be moved with the central square handle, can be rotated with the green DOT
  NB i) Images applied to compgeom do not follow the position and rotation of the main object
        They must be positioned separately... this is just how the game works.
 NB ii) The game has a proper BUG in the positioning of the object geometry when...
        A compgeom element is not static and has non-zero rotation.

* Linear Force Field can now have its force changed by dragging the yellow end of the force line.

* More Error / Crash Checks
  - Geometry has an image, but no imagerot value  (Critical)
  - Linear force field has a size, but no center (Critical)
  - Images set on compositegeom children do not display in the game (Warning)

 * Failed Checks and Issues now have a "Severity"
  - Each issue now has a severity rating of Warning or CRITICAL
  - Metaworld Issues are always CRITICAL (Red X's shown in the trees)
  - How this affects...
  |--- Saving : It will ALWAYS save the level data, and warn you of any issues
  |--- Playing: If the level has Warnings but no CRITICAL's, you get the option to Play or Cancel
  |           : If the level has CRITICAL errors, you cannot play. It would crash WoG if you tried.
  |--- GooMod : You cannot make a goomod if there are any unresolved issues.

* Changed the way the installer adds the Decrypt option on the right click menu
 - Installer now requires at least PowerUser rights.
 - Win7 still overrides (and hides) the option if you set a different program to handle .bin's
 |--- so don't do that!

*Visual Changes
  - Balls with no type show in red
  - Labels will show "!Set_Text!" until you do
  - particles will show "!Set_Effect!" until you do.
  - Rect / Circle with images shows image in correct place when there is no imagepos value

* Property changes
* New remove_when_empty flag applied to...
  - Rect / Circle image, imagepos, imagescale and tag
  - Compgeom on image, imagescale and tag but NOT imagepos, because it's not as predticable as rect or circle
  - Line Tag
  - LinearForceField Size and Center (allows you to convert a sized force field back into an ambient one)
  - Pipe Type - allows you to go back to default grey pipe, after you've specified another type.

* New read_only flag applied to...
- Elements (Cannot be cut or deleted, or additional items of that type added by right-click)
|--- Resources Element, Set Defaults Element, All "required" Addin elements

- Attributes (Cannot be edited or removed)
|--- Addin attributes spec-version, type, level->dir
|--- Resource id, Set Defaults path and idprefix

* Tooltips (Hover on attribute name in property list)
- Added to most Addin attributes
- And quite a few others in Scene and Level Tabs

* Other property changes
  - Removed (pointless) static attribute from lines
  - Radial Force Field no longer REQUIRES an id
  - Mandatory attributes with no Init value, are not added to the item
  |--- this gives the new element an Issue.. to ensure it is fixed before play / goomod
  - Level autobounds now defaults to false
  - Added OCD entry to addin template (blank entry - no ocd)

- Version 0.6.8 : DaB
* Installer has option to add En/Decrypt functions on Windows Right-Click menu
  - Optional in Installer - since it's a bit experimental.
  - Right-Click a .bin file, choose Decrypt for WOG (.xml created/overwritten in same folder)
  - Right-Click a .xml file, choose Encrypt for WOG (.bin created/overwritten in same folder)
  - Works on multiple file selections too!

* Rectangles and Circles with Images Work! (I think)
  - Geometry can be sized, moved, rotated as normal (outline handles)
  - Images can be sized and rotated as normal (Solid handles)
  - Image can (only) be moved using CENTER solid handle

* Make .goomod now asks for save location and filename
  - also remembers last location ({Level_folder} / Elsewhere)

* Closing Window (or App) warns about unsaved changes.

* Linear and Radial Forcefields can be moved and resized
  - Still working on setting the force!

* Lines can be selected and moved
 - Still working on rotating them.

* Lots of new checks/warnings added on save / play / make goomod
  - Mainly things that might look OK to you, me and WoG Editor
    -  but will crash WoG or seriously affect playability

  - Static=False and Mass=0  aka. the "Mass Crash"
  - Missing Cameras : must have 1 normal and 1 widescreen
  - Compgeom set to static=false, but has child with no Mass
  - Strands declared before balls (Fix: Strands moved to end of file on save)
  - Hinges and Motors declared before Geometry (Fix Hinges and Motors moved to end)
  - Motors attached to static geometry
  - Pipe Vertexes that are too close together.
  - Pipes with vertexes that go straight on, or turn 180deg (Wog crash)
    - Moving Pipe Vertexes now only allows a valid direction.
  - Level Exit outside scene bounds (Playability - can never reach pipe)
  - Has levelexit but no pipe (Wog crash on pipe open)
  - Pipe "Mouth" outside levelexit (Playability)

* Fixed: Mouse Coordinates should now display / update always.
* Fixed: Level cannot be re-opened after level window is closed

- Version 0.6.7 (Beta) : DaB
* !!Experimental!! "Make .goomod" feature
  - First, go to the new "Addin" tab (over with the Scene, Level, Resources ones)
    - fill in all the required fields (you'll see X's in the tree)
    - you can also right-click to add optional entries like ocd or "depends"
    - NB: There's no validity/error checking of these fields yet.. so try to get them right!
    - The info is stored in a new {LevelName}.addin.xml file

  - Then click the goomod button on the toolbar.
    - creates a subfolder called goomod inside the level folder
    - creates the addin.xml file
    - creates the "compile" folder structure and puts the level,scene and resrc XML files in it.
    - if needed, creates an "override" folder and puts copies of images and sound files in there.
      - will only copy "custom" images and sounds.. original WoG files will not be included
    - creates an {addin-id}.goomod file with everything in...
    - leaves all the xml and copied resource files in the goomod folder
      - just in case you want to tweak anything manually, and repack the .goomod yourself.
  - Finally TEST your new .goomod in GooTool - BEFORE YOU UPLOAD!

* New Goo-lbar! Add even more Goo!
  - Added BombSticky, Anchor, AnchorFriendly and AnchorSticky to the Goo-lbar

* Add more "other stuff"
  - Added Fire, Force Fields, Particles, Hinges and Pipe vertex's to the Item bar
  - and New "Auto Pipe" feature. Quick way to get a valid pipe.
     - Adds a pipe, if there isn't one, and adds 2 vertexes
        - one dead-on the levelexit
        - the other just outside the nearest scene edge.
     - NB: Will reset / override any existing pipe with the new one.

* Changes to Import Resources
  - Import "Resources" is now Import Images (only allows pngs)... because...

* New "Set Music" and "Set LoopSound" buttons
    - No need to add a resource then a "music" and then assign the id
    - Click the button, select the file.. WoG Editor does the rest.
    - If the level already had music / loopsound it will also remove the old file from resources.

- Version 0.6.6: DaB
* Add More Goo! Faster!
  - Added a load of common / useful goo types to the Toolbar

* Show / Hide
  - New toolbar allows you to show/hide different "layers" of the level
  - So far.. Cameras and Pois, ForceFields, Graphics, Geometry, Goos
  - NB: Geometry with Images
    - Hiding Graphics will hide the image but not the geometry
    - Hiding Geometry will hide both the geometry and the image.

* Scene Bounds
  - Now show as a dotted black rectangle
  - Will be RED if there's a problem... like max is less than min

* Camera now has a visual item for EndPos
  - Like POI's only darker

    - This fixes the incorrect "Original WoG level" warning, it was trying to save ALL open levels.
  - Warns if the level has "Issues" that will cause WoG to crash, but still saves it.
  - Will NOT play a level with "Issues"

* WoG Directory handling
  - Removed Toolbar button for Change Directory (Still available as Menu)
  - Detects "First Run" and automatically displays "Choose Directory" dialog
  - Checks on startup that WoG Directory is still valid.. displays Choose dialog if not.

* Coordinate Rounding
  - Positions, Centers, Sizes, Radii and Angles round to nearest 2dp (0.01)

* Strand Mode changes
  - Now displays warnings is you try to add a duplicate or invalid strand
  - Knows what Ball types can't have strands connected (Beauty's, BlockHead's etc)
    - and won't let you start a strand on them, and will warn if you try to end on one.
  - Understands that you can't have strands from an anchor to another anchor

* Now displays Camera Path (thin black line) and POI's
  - POI's display as rectangles showing how much of the scene will be visible (Approximate, but close!)
  - POI's display different colours for widescreen and normal cameras
  - POI's can be selected /  moved with the mouse
  - POI's cannot (yet) be resized / zoomed with the mouse, but changing zoom property will update rectangle size.

* Overview
World of Goo Level Editor (WooGLE) is a Gui tool for creating and editing levels for the puzzle game World of Goo.
The "original" version (written by Nitrozark.. up to v0.5) was mostly functional, but very clunky and difficult to use for inexperienced users, and experienced ones.

WooGLE aims to build on the good parts of original, and make it much easier to use.

* Major Improvements and New Features (beyond v0.5)
New Selection routines remove the need for separate Select Mode and Move Mode
New Toolbars for adding objects and adding Goos
Import Images directly from files held anywhere
Strand Mode : For adding strands between Goos
"One-Shot" Set Music and Set LoopSound buttons
All visual elements can be moved, resized and rotated graphically.
Handles TEXT resources for signs and labels
Allows direct creation of goomod files (used to distribute levels to other users)
Goos look like Goos
Undo and Redo functions
Many Many error checks added to warn / prevent WoG crashing when you run the level.

Full version information is held in Version text.
